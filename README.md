# Human_Detection-CV

a) Source code file names:
1. create_data.py
2. HoG.py
3. neural_net.py
4. run_NN.py

b) Instructions on how to compile and run the code:
1. First place above four files in a folder.
2. Inside this folder create four folders as ‘positive_train’, ‘negative_train’, ‘positive_test’, and ‘negative_test’.
3. Place all the positive train images in positive train folder and likewise place the other images in the respective folders.
4. First run the create_data.py file. This file will create two csv files ‘train.csv’ and ‘test.csv’.
5. Then run the ‘run_NN.py’ file. It will display the accuracy and the predictions as outputs.
6. Or you can run the CV_Project2.bat batch file which will do steps 4 and 5 for you.
